## Introduction

PCB Detection is a project aimed at automating the process of detecting PCBs in images. The code uses a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify and localize PCBs within an image.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3.7 or above installed on your system. You can follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/avinash275/PCB-Detection.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd PCB-Detection


3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. After that run Command

streamlit run main.py

Then after that in your default browser will see application in which you have to select input image and after that you will get defected portion of image.
